      <description>Philly has a great tech scene. I regularly attend the Philly DevOps group, I make occasional appearances at PhillyDB and the Python group PhillyPUG, and I try to get to some of the great annual events in Philadelphia like Redsnake and BarCamp. I&#39;ve been the sometimes host of the AWS NYC meetup and was the lead organizer for PhillyPUG for a highly chaotic year or so. Feel free to find me at one of these events and tell me how much my blog sucks.</description>
