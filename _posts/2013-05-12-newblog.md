This is my blog.  More to the point, it's _my_ blog, which means that the opinions here are mine and not those of my employer, co-workers, spouse, etc.  I'm going to attempt to post once a week, updating on Sundays or thereabouts.

This blog is currently deployed on Github Pages.  At the time of this writing it's a MVB (Minimum Viable Blog).  The CSS is still a bit of a mess from where I ripped off [better designers](http://carlosbecker.com/posts/up-a-jekyll-theme/) than me, particularly on Android.  And I don't have Google Analytics or any of those sorts of things one expects to find when one goes digging through the page source.

For the time being I'm eschewing a commenting system. If you'd like to comment on the things you read here, feel free to post on Twitter or the appropriate Github issues page.
