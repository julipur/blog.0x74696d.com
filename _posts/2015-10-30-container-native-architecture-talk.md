title: Container-Native Architecture [talk]
category: Joyent, Docker
---

On October 29th I gave a talk on container-native architecture at [ContainerDays NYC](http://dynamicinfradays.org/events/2015-nyc/).

[From the programme:](http://dynamicinfradays.org/events/2015-nyc/programme.html#architecture)

>Moving your application into a container and deploying it to production is a great first step towards taking advantage of containerization. This gets you past "works on my machine", and Docker makes this easy. But the real value of containers -- fast immutable deployments, maximizing resource utilization, and bare-metal performance -- comes from an architecture optimized for containers. This is container-native architecture.

> Tim will explore the story of a real-world large scale production microservices deployment of Docker, and the challenges faced in both design and operations of migrating this kind of multi-faceted application to a container-native architecture.


You can find my slides [here](http://0x74696d.com/talk-containerdays-nyc-2015/#/). I experimented with `reveal.js` for these, so use `<space`> to advance and `s` to get the speaker's notes.

A recording of the talk can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWJtbhKyLQY). I've been told by the organizers that they're going to clean up this up and when that happens I'll update this link.
