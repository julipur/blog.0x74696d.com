<p>Philly has a great tech scene.  I regularly attend the Python group PhillyPUG, I've been making appearances at Philly DevOps and PhillyDB recently, and I try to get to some of the great annual events in Philadelphia like Redsnake and BarCamp.  On behalf of my employer, I am also the sometimes-host of the AWS NYC meetup. Feel free to find me at one of these events and tell me how much my blog sucks.  Or receive questionable advice about your deployment process, software infrastructure, love-live, or startup idea for the low-low price of having a beer or a cup of coffee with me.  I occasionally get it into my head to stand up and talk in front of other people, and some of those talks will make their way into this blog in the future.</p>

<p>Behold some of my small contributions to the world below, and realize that you should definitely start working on some open source projects if you aren't already.  I'm gearing up to start contributing to some larger or more important projects, so stay tuned here or in future blog postings to see what kind of comically-bad PRs I send the way of your favorite FOSS project.</p>
