<p>I'm a software developer, DevOps guy, and solver-of-problems-with-duct-tape.  I've got a proven nose for hunting down and eliminating technical debt and process inefficiencies in small-to-midsize engineering organizations of various sorts. This is my blog.</p>

<p>I'm a product manager at <a href="https://www.joyent.com/">Joyent</a> where my work is focused on "blueprints". I develop, write about, and talk about projects that demonstrate the best practices for container-native deployments on Joyent's Triton platform. Triton is a Docker API wrapping Joyent's existing bare-metal containerization technology built on Solaris zones, and it's pretty awesome so you should give it a try.</p>

<p> Before I joined Joyent, I managed the DevOps team and the software infrastructure for <a href="http://www.dramafever.com/company/careers.html">DramaFever</a>. We ran a large scale microservices architecture on AWS for millions of users. I got to work on things like builds and deployments, performance and reliability projects, our analytics ingest firehose, and tuning our RDS and DynamoDB configs.</p>

<p>I work mostly with Python and Go and have professional experience with C# and AutoLisp. I have some training in security design and pen-testing, and like to crack open some shell code now-and-then to keep my skills sharp. I've dabbled in C and Erlang and have a strong interest in learning more about language internals and low-level systems programming.</p>

<p>I started my working life as an architect &mdash; buildings, not software. But in an industry which like many others is being eaten by software, I quickly fell into a technical role as an expert in developing tools for estimation and CAD automation, as well as information-rich 3D modeling (also known as Building Information Modeling or BIM). With experience in designing secure and life-safety-critical architectural environments in the telecommunications facilities, biological and chemical hazardous materials facilities, and pharmaceutical manufacturing, I've turned those skills into an inspiration to focus on building rock-solid information systems.</p>
