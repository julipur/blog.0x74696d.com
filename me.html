<p>I'm a software developer, devops guy, and solver-of-problems-with-duct-tape.  I've got a proven nose for hunting down and eliminating technical debt and process inefficiencies in small-to-midsize engineering organizations of various sorts.  This is my blog.</p>

<p>I work mostly with Python and have professional experience with C# and AutoLisp.  My everyday work involves software-infrastructure engineering and devops on a large-scale Django application for several million users on AWS; I get to work on things like deployments, caching libraries, our analytics ingest firehose, and tuning RDS and DynamoDB configs.  I have some training in security design and pen-testing, and like to crack open some shell code now-and-then to keep my skills sharp.  I've dabbled in C (and recently Go and Erlang) and have a strong interest in learning more about language internals and low-level systems programming.</p>

<p>I started my working life as an architect &mdash; buildings, not software.  But in an industry which like many others is being eaten by software, I quickly fell into a technical role as an expert in developing tools for estimation and CAD automation, as well as information-rich 3D modeling (also known as Building Information Modeling or BIM).  With experience in designing secure and life-safety-critical architectural environments in telecommunications facilities, biological and chemical hazardous materials handling, and pharmaceutical manufacturing, I've turned those skills into an inspiration to focus on building rock-solid information systems.</p>
